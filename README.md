# lemr-Compiler-CSc-372-Project-2

This was a 4-week project intended to take what we learned in class and implement our own basic programming language.

We wanted to make a language that was somewhere between C/Java and Python.

We implemented variable assignment, conditionals, for loops, and a print statement
Examples of each can be found here https://github.com/LukasXavier/lemr-Compiler-CSc-372-Project-2/blob/102f755cbadd4544831ea4f74b24332c3708e816/extra/LEMR%20presentation.pdf
In our presentation power point.

This language is far from complete and has many bugs

#Known Bugs
for loops don't like to go backwards `fori (x-1, 10, 1)` does not work properly

Some niche nested statements may break
